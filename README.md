# notebooks
Some of the IPython notebooks I've worked on over the years

## Rectangle_Subdivision_and_Intersection_Over_Union.ipynb
Solving two problems related to computer vision: one is how to subdivide projected rectangle equally (e.g. given the four edges of a row of parking spots, and the number of spots, how to determine where the lines between them are on a picture taken at an angle). The other is calculating the area of the intersection between two polygons. 

## ZR2_zavrsni_rad.ipynb
Solving a BVP (boundary value problem) via the shooting method in order to estimate water transport in dessicated (extremely dry) soil

## hoglib.ipynb
An implementation of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients method of feature extraction for a computer vision project. Here is an article with more info: https://learnopencv.com/histogram-of-oriented-gradients/; and here is the original paper outlining the method: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1467360

## linreg_v0.3.ipynb
A quick study comparing the efficacy of two different methods for solving 2-dimensional linear regression (these being gradient descent and SVD)

## pap_smears_exploratory_analysis.ipynb
An exploratory analysis of a dataset of pap smears, used to eventually develop a visual k-means classifier which tells potentially cancerous cells from healthy ones

## pap_smears_k_means_final.ipynb
The aforementioned classifier that was eventually developed.
